# Uber & Lyft Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This machine learning project analyzes Uber and Lyft ride data from Boston to predict ride prices, travel times, and service availability. The dataset includes features such as ride costs, weather conditions, and pickup/drop-off locations. Key factors like time of day, day of the week, and weather are used to uncover patterns influencing pricing dynamics, comparing Uber and Lyft pricing strategies.
